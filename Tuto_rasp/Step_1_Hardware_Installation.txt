# Current State
    Rasp loaded with fresh new Raspbian Jessie.
    HDMI/VGA adaptater doesn't work with my screen. 
    Plan to put local ssh access through another screen then not physically touch the rasp ever again.

# Process
    - Establishing a confortable access to the Rasp -
        Change interfaces, put static ip in */etc/network/interfaces*
        *update-rc.d -f dhcpcd remove* to have an static IP
        After restart and plug to the router (Bouygues Bbox) it seems that the settings gets overwritten and get an IP by the router. It will be a bug to fix
        Anyway the rasp work with attributed ip we'll keep it like that until then.

        We want a root keyed ssh connnection to this computer to have our peace of mind and by ease of access.
        We are connected to pi by default and we want to be root. So we set up root password with *sudo passwd root* and connect as root.
	(Bonus : if you don't like the root PS1 you can copy the one from pi, with *echo $PS1 >style* as pi then *PS1=$(cat style)* as root)
        So we change the keyed ssh port *Port xxxxx* for better security and *PermitRootLogin without-password* in the file */etc/ssh/sshd_config*
        Then we generate a private and a public key with WinSCP/puttyGen. keep the private on in our side et put the public one into the */root/.ssh/authorized_keys* folder. Of course we remove the private one on our Rasp.
        We change the privilege to 700 on */root/.shh/*.
	A little reboot-a-roo *reboot*
