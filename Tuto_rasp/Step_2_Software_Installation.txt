# Current State
    We have a Pi with Jessis, accessible by keyed ssh on our local router.
    It is connected to the Internet.
    Plan to instal nodeJs and don't touch it until we have something to put on it.

# Process 
    - Installing NodeJs - 
        On suit simplement le tuto à cette adresse "https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/"
	On va ensuite tester avec un site préfait, pour ceci nous allons transferrer depuis Windows à Putty (oui je ne suis pas encore sous linux, souci matériel)
        Works like charm, with just a *node server.js* the server launches and we cana ccess is in local. Briant.

    - Accessibility -
        We'll see if it's accessible from the outside. First we redirect the port 80 to the port 3000 of our Pi Server because that what or server.js is listening on.
        Then we get our public ip : *curl icanhazip.com* -> 176.144.71.96
	And it work like it was made for it ! Success !
	to keet it running when we are not connected trough putty we can use either "Screen" or *nohup node server.js &*
